## vuln scan

Scan a target  for all vulnerabilities in the default script library for the vuln category

`zzvuln <target>` ([source](https://github.com/TurboLabIt/zzalias/blob/master/zzalias.sh))

```

📝 Certain scans attempt to verify a vulnerability by attempting to exploit the vulnerability. 
In some cases, a successful exploitation will result in changes to the service.
